description: This is always kind of a depressing time of the year for me because winter is literally only weeks away and all the real world racing series are finishing up their seasons. I am excited though to be heading to Homestead on Friday to celebrate our NASCAR Peak Antifreeze Series champion Kenny Humpe and get to watch what is really the only race left in the season.
